ONLINE WEB APP USING DIFFERENT APIs 
IN THE LIMITED TIME AND KNOWLEDGE, WE BULIT A WEB APP WHICH SHOWS WEATHER DATA OF ANY CITY THE USER ENTERS. IT SHOWS THE TEMPERATURE, THE FEELS-LIKE TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY LEVEL AND OBSERVABLE WEATHER CONDITION(CLOUDY, SUNNY ETC.)
AS A SMALL PHOTO OF IT. ALL OF THIS DATA IS GATHERED WITH THE HELP OF THE WEATHERSTACK API.
THE OTHER ENTERTAINMENT FEATURE OUR WEBSITE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE TOP 15 HEADLINES AT THAT MOMENT BY TRUSTWORTHY SOURCES LIKE BBC AND CNN. THIS INFORAMTION IS PROVIDED BY THE MEDIASTACK API.
